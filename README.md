# CDF AI Engineering Hackathon

**Live URL:** 

Welcome! This is your personal repository for the CDF AI Engineering Hackathon. The problem statement is included in this repo - read it carefully before you start.

### Run locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run src/app.py
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `EIA_API_KEY`, `FRED_API_KEY`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` (see below). Do not commit `.env`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Read the problem statement** - [`PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md`](./PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md)
2. **Fill out your planning document** - [`planning/PLANNING.md`](./planning/PLANNING.md) before writing any code
3. **Build your solution** inside the `src/` directory
4. **Deploy** to Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or similar — set your API keys as environment variables in your hosting dashboard, never in the repo
5. **Update this README** with your live URL and reflections before the deadline

## 📝 A Note on Commit History

Your git commit history is part of the evaluation. Here is what a clean history looks like:

- **Commit regularly** — at least once per meaningful chunk of work (e.g. "Add IRR calculation", "Integrate EIA API", "Build map tab")
- **Write descriptive messages** — not "fix", "update", or "asdf". A good message tells someone what changed and why
- **Do not squash everything into one commit** at the end — we should be able to follow your progress through the history
- **Do not commit API keys, `.env` files, or `node_modules`** — use `.gitignore`

Think of your commit history as a log of how you think and work, not just a save button.
